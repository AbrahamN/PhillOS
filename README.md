# MellOS
*A very simple kernel I'm working on in my free time.* 
## Some useful resources
Some of the resources I found most useful are [the OSDEV wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page), [osdever.net](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/) (from which I basically stole the part regarding interrupts), this [keyboard scancode map](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html), and of course the most fundamental of all resources: [RTFM!!!](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-combined-volumes-3a-3b-3c-and-3d-system-programming-guide.html)

## Future of MellOS
I'm doing this in my spare time, which basically means "during a small part of the summer and a week or so around Christmas". Feel free to do whatever you like with this, as long as you don't physically (nor psychologically) harm people or other animals I'm absolutely fine with it.

### And now for something completely different:
Cheese squared
